Scene graph type hierarchy abstraction for use with [`specs`].

Builds up a `Hierarchy` resource, by querying a user supplied `Parent` component.
Requires the component to be `Tracked`.

Will send modification events on an internal `EventChannel`. Note that `Removed` events
does not mean the `Parent` component was removed from the component storage, just that the
`Entity` will no longer be considered to be a part of the `Hierarchy`. This is because the user
may wish to either remove only the component, the complete `Entity`, or something completely
different. When an `Entity` that is a parent gets removed from the hierarchy, the full tree of
children below it will also be removed from the hierarchy.

## Usage

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
specs-hierarchy = "0.2.1"
```

## Example

```rust
use specs::prelude::{Component, DenseVecStorage, Entity, FlaggedStorage};
use specs_hierarchy::{Hierarchy, Parent as HParent};

/// Component for defining a parent entity.
///
/// The entity with this component *has* a parent, rather than *is* a parent.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, Ord, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct Parent {
    /// The parent entity
    pub entity: Entity,
}

impl Component for Parent {
    type Storage = FlaggedStorage<Self, DenseVecStorage<Self>>;
}

impl HParent for Parent {
    fn parent_entity(&self) -> Entity {
        self.entity
    }
}
```
